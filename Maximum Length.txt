Given the maximum occurrences of a, b, and c in a string. Your task is to make the string containing only a, b, and c such that no three consecutive characters are the same. If the resultant string equals to a+b+c, return the length (a+b+c) otherwise -1.


Intuition :

There's a very simple intuition, which is not a single character must occur more than twice in a row, so we need to check a condition :

--> if max occuring character - 2 is greater than twice of the remaining two, return -1
--> else return the sum of occurrences of a, b and c



You can refer to the code for further understanding :)
